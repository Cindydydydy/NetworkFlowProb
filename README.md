# NetworkFlowProb

The project is used to solve the real-world network flow problem. 

FlowProb_v3 is the main code to run this project, which finds the delivery information first, then forwarding, treatment, conditioning, and sourcing. The previous process's data is based on the following process. 
In lines 12 and 19, we can decide the output and input file names, respectively.

The five .xlsx files are the corresponding output files.

P.S. While writing this project's code, I found that the best way to solve this problem is via a directed graph and searching algorithm.
